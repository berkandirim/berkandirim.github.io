What were we doing before `@font-face` is introduced with CSS3? We had just a handful *web-safe* fonts, and we would use them over and over again on different projects. My favorite without a doubt, was [Tahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoma_(typeface)). It was cooler than Arial and better looking than Verdana.

But I've always tried the fonts on my local machine for the websites I've built.
